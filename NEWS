- The UCL for individual observations in Phase I is :
ucl <- ((colm - 1) ^ 2) / colm * qbeta(1 - alpha, p / 2, ((colm - p - 1) / 2) ) 
See Tracy, Young, and Mason (1992) “Multivariate Control Charts for Individual Observations,” 

- The previous UCL was 
ucl <- ((colm - 1) ^ 2) / colm * qbeta(1 - alpha, p / 2, (((2 * (colm - 1) ^ 2) / (3 * colm - 4) - p - 1) / 2)), which was propossed by
Sullivan and Woodall (1996). “A Comparison of Multivariate Control Charts for Individual Observations,”
This method is used by MINITAB 17.
